# TTSP
This repository contains the source code of the novel power budgeting technique, called "*TTSP: Transient-Temperature Based Safe Power Budgeting*". TTSP computes safe power constraint values as a function of the spatial alignment of active cores and their transient temperature in a multi-/many-core processor. The use of T-TSP leads to better exploitation of the processorâ€™s thermal headroom and therefore improved performance in a thermally constrained environment.

# Publication

Details of TTSP can be found in the following ICCD 2021 paper. Please consider citing this paper in your work if you use this software or a modified version of it.
